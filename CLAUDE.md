# Dotfiles Project - Local Instructions

> **Project Context**
> This repository contains **backup copies** of dotfiles and configuration files. When the user asks questions or requests changes, they are referring to the backup files **in this repository**, NOT the system's actual dotfiles.

## Important Notes

* **DO NOT modify system dotfiles directly** (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)
* **DO NOT read or modify files in `./claude/`** — this directory contains backup copies for bootstrap.sh, not active configurations
* All operations should target the backup files within this repository
* When the user asks about configurations, they mean the files stored here for version control and backup purposes
* If the user wants to apply changes to their actual system dotfiles, they will explicitly state that

For general coding style, commit conventions, and interaction rules, refer to the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
